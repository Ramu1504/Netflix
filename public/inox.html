Dasa Mahavidya Temple
Delve into the profound realms of worship, where Lord Shiva's tranquil presence beckons seekers to embrace stillness and surrender to timeless rituals. Rooted in Tantra Shastra, the ancient wisdom unveils three sacred vidyas—Hadi, Kali, and Sadi, each carrying its own lineage and traditions. Matsyendranath's propagation of the Kaula Chara tradition underscores the timeless pursuit of spiritual enlightenment. Above all practices, the Dasa Mahavidya stands supreme, offering seekers a path to complete spiritual fulfillment.

Meanwhile, the divine mother Goddess Shakti guides seekers through varied practices, accompanying them on their spiritual journey. Worship of Shakti and Shiva, the presiding deities of each planet, promises solace from Navagraha dosham, while the Dasa Maha Vidyas, representing ten divine manifestations, illuminate the path with their unique wisdom, all emanating from the eternal wisdom of Adi Shakti.
